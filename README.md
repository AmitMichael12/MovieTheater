# MovieTheater

In order to run this project you need to create a .env file in the root of the backend folder which looks like :
MONGO_URI = your mongoDB connection string.

I have created a seed function which will seed the database with few screenings and 50 available seats in each screening, please run Node seed.js in order to run it.


Run the backend with npm install and then npm start , it will run on default under localhost:5000
Run the frontend with npm install and then npm run dev , it will run on default under localhost:5173
